My solutions for the Advent of Code (AoC) challenge, 2020 edition

## Disclaimer

I try to make my solutions as readable as possible. Nevertheless, I've always tried to find an efficient way to solve each of them instead of just use a brut-force approach.

:warning: Please, use my solutions only if you've already try solving the puzzle by yourself first.   
You will learn so much more by doing it that way, instead of looking at an already made solution or even worse, caring only for the result.

> The greater the obstacle, the more glory in overcoming it.

## Basic statistics

Here are some overall details about each solution.

:warning: Work In Progress
